# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

Our Gardening Application is designed to allow users to manage their gardens more effectively than previous gardening applications. While other gardening applications are error prone, inaccurate, and hard to use, our Gardening Application is simple, easy to use, and highly informative. 

Our Gardening Application allows users to:
Add plants to their garden
Remove plants in their garden
Browse properties and maintenance information for each of their respective plants
Organize plant maintenance using a calendar 
Search and browse through plants that interest them
Personalize their account (multiple users, change settings)

In this report, we summarize the findings of our user research, heuristic evaluation, as well as discuss/justify our final design and outline our recommendations for future iterations of this design. 


## Introduction

The objective of our project was to create a gardening guide in the form of a mobile application. The gardening guide we developed is currently able to assist in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a users garden. Gardening applications are fairly common, but many lack expected features, are hard to use, error-prone, or are poorly organized. Our objective/motivation was to design a gardening application that addressed these issues, and would meet users expectations. 

We expect our application to be used by gardeners with variable experience and background. Thus, the age group, technological abilities, physical and mental abilities, and gender vary quite a bit in our expected users. However, we expect most of our users to not be technological experts. Since gardening is typically a home hobby, the context under which we expect our application to be used in is a relatively calm and relaxed home setting. 


## Design Problem

Problem: Design a gardening application which assists in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a given garden. 

The focus for our project was to make a gardening application that was streamlined and useful. Many gardening applications are clouded with erroneous content, are poorly updated, error prone, difficult to use, etc, and thus we wanted to design an application that addressed many of these problems. Below we outlined a set of issues/characteristics that would need to be addressed when designing our application: 

Simple/Organized 
Abstract away useless information, settings, and content.
Easy to navigate (User Friendly)
Common problem among current applications. Menu design should be clearly laid out and the function of each page should be obvious. 
Useful
Many applications get too focused on providing accurate plant information that they forget about the management aspect.
Personalizable 
Everyones garden and practices are different. Designing for everyone is impossible, thus we should allow the user to modify settings to enable/disable features and/or naming conventions. 
Accurate (in regards to plant properties and maintenance) 
The information provided in regards to watering and pruning schedules on some applications are not always accurate. Thus, it is important that we design an application that has information that is well sourced. 

Many garden applications do not successfully address the issues above, which makes them unpopular and not useful. By addressing these issues, we hoped to design a gardening application that would prove to be useful, informative, and user friendly. 


## User Research and Findings

When we were conducting our user research, we employed the following three research methods. Their description and findings are below (For more detailed method descriptions and justifications refer to P3):
Interviews
Survey
Secondary Research

1. Summary of Interview Findings:
We interviewed 4 individuals that we considered to be a good representation of our target audience. We sat down with them, asked our questions and summarized their responses. Listed below are our primary findings from the interviews:

Our interviewees mainly keep track of their garden by memory or visual assessment; although one of them uses a calendar.
A common issue seems to be finding the time to do gardening.
A common goal is to be able to see the results of their work. As in all their plants survive and look great.
The participants seemed to be at least somewhat familiar with technology.
Interviewees were confused by some of the questions and required clarification. This was particularly problematic as we didn’t want to influence our interviewees answers.

2. Summary of Survey Findings
The survey we created consisted of 10 questions and none of them were required to be filled out by the participant. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions so that we could have a more qualitative analysis of the results. We posted the survey on SurveyMonkey and then shared the link to it on social media. That resulted in 12 responses to our survey. Listed below is a summary of our major findings:

Nearly all of the participants grow some kind of edible plants in their gardens. Indicating that some kind of harvest tracking should be a high priority feature.
Most people seem to spend less than 3 hours on gardening per week, at least on average. 
Exactly half of our participants are the only person involved in maintaining their garden. 
People tend to either water plants on a fixed schedule or only wait a few days for rainfall. Most participants seem to get a decent amount of rainfall so we should certainly consider rainfall when designing the watering/maintaining section of our application.
Most participants would consider using an application for managing their garden.
Despite tools for planning/setting up a garden winning by first past the post standards, tools for maintaining/managing a garden seem to be more desired.
Most of our participants were not gardening experts so they may want the application to at least somewhat guide them through gardening.
As expected, most people skipped the last question but there is a comment that such an application would be most useful for managing lots of plants. Thus we should make our UI work just as well with hundreds or thousands of plants as it does with a few dozen.
Overall the survey was more insightful than our 4 interviews even though we considered its questions to be less detailed than the interview questions.

## Design and Justification
The link to our Hi-Fi prototype is below:
http://lqcvkk.axshare.com/

As stated in the introduction, the focus of our project was to make a gardening application that was streamlined and useful. From our secondary research findings, we determined that many gardening applications are clouded with erroneous content, are poorly updated, error prone, difficult to use, etc. Thus, we outlined a set of issues that were known to be problematic and then designed our interface with them in mind. These issues helped justify our design choices, and shape our Hi-Fi Prototype:

Simple/Organized 
Each screen has as few buttons as possible, and has as little text as possible. The design of the “Plant Info” screen was harder to simplify/organize because we wanted to make sure the user had all the information they would need to properly manage their garden. As a temporary solution, we made the text editable, so the user can remove or add additional text.
The “Plant Search” screen design was also influenced by this concept. We wanted to keep the search feature as simple as possible so that people unfamiliar with mobile devices would find it easy to use.

Easy to navigate (User Friendly)
All screens displaying information specific to the garden itself have plainer backgrounds and colour palettes, this is to differentiate them from the navigation menus. As well as making them simpler to read, navigate through, and understand. 
This impacted the design of our headings. We wanted to convey as best we could what the function of each page was. Hence headings such as “My Plants”, “My Gardens”, “Plant Search”, and “Plant Browse”. 

Useful
We determined early on that certain features in gardening applications were more popular compared to others. Among these were features allowing users to schedule garden maintenance, and allow them to examine individual plant properties. This led to the implementation of the “Plant Information” and “Maintenance Schedule” screens in our prototype. 

Personalizable 
Our user research indicated that in some cases, multiple individuals share a garden with another person in the same household. Thus, we implemented the “My Profile” tab to allow multiple users to create and customize their gardens. Thereby allowing multiple users in one household to manage their garden using the same device. 
Some of the features like the “weather services” setting may not be wanted by some users and similarly, others prefer different plant naming conventions. Thus, we created a settings tab to allow users to set their own preferences. Thus, more experienced users can choose which features they want implemented. 

Accurate (in regards to plant properties and maintenance) 
It is difficult to ensure accuracy in regards to plant information due to the sheer amount of plant species in a typical database. However, in our case, we cross referenced at least 3-4 separate sites to ensure that the properties listed, and the watering and pruning schedule were consistent among them for the example we included in our prototype (the Alba Rose). 

We justified many of our design ideas by referring to the issues above. By doing so, we hoped that our gardening application would prove to be useful, informative, and user friendly. Included below is a set of storyboards illustrating the final design of our prototype, with the design elements that were explained and justified above. A brief walkthrough is presented with each storyboard. We included the storyboards below in order to demonstrate how the issues above shaped elements of our design, and to get a better sense of how the application works:


## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

In order to evaluate the design of our system, we performed a heuristic evaluation. This involved each group member doing a heuristic analysis separately and then meeting as a group to run through the heuristic analysis together and discuss violated heuristics and assign severity ratings. We decided to present our heuristic evaluation in table form, with the table being sorted by severity rating (highest to lowest). Thus, our table was sorted based upon the problems that we wished to address first. Below is our group heuristic evaluation formatted into a table with collectively agreed upon severity ratings and potential fixes:

|Heuristic Name|Issue|Possible Solutions|Severity Rating| | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | |Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page that provides information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. More specifically, add an information icon at the top right or bottom left of each screen, explaining the functionality and containing various tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some users.|4| |Error Prevention|Currently, if a user presses the “x” button next to their garden, the garden is deleted with no “confirm” prompt. |Add a prompt that asks the user to either confirm or cancel their selection.|3| |Visibility of system status|Some of the options in the settings tab change “modes” such as plant naming, language, accounting for weather, etc. which might be confusing to users.|Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. For example, allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page.|3| |User Control and Freedom|It is slightly difficult to return to the home screen as there is no dedicated home button. Currently, the user has to press the back button repeatedly until they reach the home screen. |Add a home button to the top right of the screen. The home button would be a symbol representing a generic house, text can be added to be more descriptive. |3| |Flexibility and efficiency of use|Currently, the system only allows users to search by plant names; there is no browse or search by category implementation. |We can create a list of plants and store them based upon category. Thus, a user can simply search an entire category of plants rather than a single plant.|3| |Recognition rather than recall|The search feature requires at least a vague memory of what is being searched for.|Add a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for something.|3| |Consistency and standards|GardenList has its elements in a list, PlantList has its elements in a grid, and then PlantSearch displays its results in a list.|Either always use a grid or always use a list. Just stay consistent.|3| |Consistency and Standards|Currently, there are two ways to add plants to a garden; either through the standard list method, or using the visual “Plant Browse” screen. However, users may be confused as to whether or not they are actually different, and may never use both methods.|We can create an application guide or help section to inform the user of the two different methods, and their purpose/functionality.|3| |Match between system and the real world|The categorization system would be primarily based on phylogenies. Users may not understand phylogeny categorization.|Implement a setting allowing users to design their own categorizations. They can then group plants based upon their own criteria.|2| |Visibility of System |The search gives the user no feedback; no symbols, prompts, etc. The user simply has to wait and hope that their search returns results. |Have a “loading…” pop up, or a spinner that lets the user know that the system is currently conducting a search. | | |Consistency and Standards|The background for the MyGardens, MyPlantList, and the main menu are vastly different to all other pages. |Find a compromise between the two backgrounds and use a background that is best suited for ALL of the screens. |2| |Consistency and Standards|The plant info and plant browse pages are very similar in format, but serve completely different purposes. |Use a different naming/colour palette to differentiate the two interfaces. |2| |Visibility of system status|When the user wants to search for a specific plant in the search bar, it will give the list of plants, however, it never displays whether the plant is found or not. Thus, the user could be returned a list of plants that are not what they searched for, or nothing at all (in which case they’ll assume the application is still searching).|Make a dialog that confirms whether the plant that the users searched is found or not. |2| |Consistency and standards|The cross on PlantInfo sort of looks like you would remove the plant name rather than the plant.|Perhaps moving it up to beside the header.|2| |Aesthetic and Minimalist design|The properties tab in plantinfo and plantbrowse, contains a lot of information; some of which might seem irrelevant to the user. |Edit the information that is not necessary; anything that doesn’t improve the users experience. |1| |Aesthetic and minimalist design|When the users want to search a specific plant, it will give a list of plants. It is sorted by the best match. However, it gives unrelated plants at the same time.|The search will only output the one that the users want to add and the rest of plants should not be shown.|1|

Based on the severity ratings above, we compiled the following list of issues that must be fixed in future iterations of the design (problems with a severity rating of 3 or higher). Their possible solutions and the heuristics violated are outlined in the table above:
The lack of a confirmation prompt when removing a garden.
The lack of a help feature.
The settings options basically serving as modes.
The search feature relying on recall rather than recognition.
The plants basically lacking any kind of sorting.
The inconsistent layouts used where we have lists for some things and grids for others.
The two different ways of adding a plant may be confusing to users.
The lack of a return to menu button.

Many of the heuristic violations identified above had to do with the layout of the system as a whole. Some of the menu designs were confusing, and not as intuitive to use as we previously thought. However, many of these issues are easily solvable. Among the most important issues is that of the search bar, which prevents users from browsing through plants they may want to buy, or searching based on category rather than plant name. This was an issue that came up both during the prototype demo and while conducting the heuristic evaluation. It differs from the other issues as it is more difficult to address, as the search bar implementation would need to be removed completely and replaced with an entirely new “browse” feature. 

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

From the Heuristic Evaluation and the comments from the prototype presentation, we came up with the following set of solutions to address the major usability issues identified in our hi-fi prototype:

Add a confirmation button when creating or removing a garden
(Justification) The lack of a confirmation prompt means that the user can accidentally delete their entire garden, which they may have spent hours organizing. This is a major issue as this makes the application not only user un-friendly but frustrating to use. 

Make modes clear and modifiable (or remove them entirely) 
(Justification) The presence of these modes will no doubt be confusing to new users. They also make the application less discoverable as modifying these settings could completely change how the application works/is formatted.  

Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. For example, allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page
(Justification) Currently, the user must navigate to the settings menu by pressing “back” repeatedly in order to enable or disable weather services (this modifies the plant maintenance schedule according to the weather at your location). This is a minor problem, as users would not be able to compare the effect it has on garden maintenance easily. It makes more sense to have the option enabled here, or at least have an icon that can redirect to the setting page. 

Implement a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for a plant name
(Justification) The current system employs a search bar to look up plants. This means that users must know how to spell their plant names accurately, and can only view plants they know of. This is a poor design choice, a browse feature that allows users to look through different categories and groupings makes more sense. 

Unify the layout of similar parts of the app so that it is more consistent
(Justification) Multiple interfaces in the application have different layouts, despite working similarly. This is confusing. The lack of consistency makes the application less learnable.  

Implement a return to main menu header for the entire app
(Justification) Having to click “back” repeatedly to get to the home screen is not only tedious, but also time consuming and frustrating. A simple home button would fix this quickly. 

Create a help menu which can be accessed from any page
(Justification) The lack of a help menu means that the user has no way of figuring out what each button is for, or how to use the app; they must proceed by trial and error. Initially, we considered this to be a catastrophic error, but after reconsideration, this appears to be a minor issue (a well designed interface should not need a help button). 


The above list of solutions gives an overview of what we could do to improve the current application, but we also had concerns whether our current design/structure was actually the best way of building a gardening application. Most of the issues we identified were from user research, which also shaped the layout, which features we implemented, and various other aspects of the design. We interviewed gardeners, conducted surveys, and even looked at similar applications. However, we still are slightly uncertain if real world users would actually like our design, and if the features we implemented would actually work.Thus, in the next iteration of the design, we would like to conduct more user research, with much larger sample sets for both the interviews and surveys. Thus, we would get a better understanding of our targeted users, their expectations, goals, and feelings. 

    Finally, we were fairly unsatisfied with some of our layouts/graphics/transitions in our HiFi-Prototype. Time constraints meant that we couldn’t make each screen as visually enticing as we wanted, and had to find a compromise. This was especially true of the “My Plants” page which was not only sparse, but visually unappealing. This made it difficult to imagine what the application would actually look like, and since this is a high fidelity prototype, the appearance of the screens should be relatively close to what the actual application would look like. Thus, for the next iteration of the design, we would do some C.R.A.P design in order to help break things up; make headers more obvious, further remove blocks of unnecessary text, make the screens more consistent, and more visually enticing to the user. 

## Conclusions

Our prototype successfully implemented all of the necessary features we outlined early on, but we, as well as others, identified numerous problems regarding our layout and some of the features. The findings from our heuristic evaluation identified similar issues. We examined possible solutions, and came up with a set of recommended fixes for future iterations of the design. Further user research, and more data will help refine/address many of the poorly designed aspects of our application. All things considered, we are fairly satisfied with our prototype and are confident that by addressing the issues presented above, we would eliminate many of the reservations we (and others) have with the current implementation.
