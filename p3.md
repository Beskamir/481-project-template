# P3: Hi-fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation

## Link to Demo System

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link to our Hi-fi prototype](http://lqcvkk.axshare.com/#g=1&p=mainmenu)

## Highlight Walkthrough

###Add a plant to a garden (list implementation):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task type is important and routine. Most users first goal when opening the app is to add their plants into their “virtual garden”. 

###Remove a Plant:

###Browsing through plant information and maintenance:

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

All our heuristic evaluations combined into a single table with duplicates removed and collectively agreed upon severity ratings and potential solutions.

|Heuristic Name|Issue|Possible Solutions|Severity Rating|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Aesthetic and Minimalist design|The properties tab in plantinfo and plantbrowse, contains a lot of information; some of which might seem irrelevant to the user. |Edit the information that is not necessary; anything that doesn’t improve the users experience. |1|
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|When the users want to search a specific plant, it will give a list of plants. It is sorted by the best match. However, it gives unrelated plants at the same time.|The search will only output the one that the users want to add and the rest of plants should not be shown.|1|
|Consistency and Standards|The background for the MyGardens, MyPlantList, the main menu are vastly different to all other pages. |Find a compromise between the two backgrounds and use a background that is best suited for ALL of the screens. |2|
|Consistency and Standards|The plant info and plant browse pages are very similar in format, but serve completely different purposes. |Use a different naming/colour palette to differentiate the two interfaces. |2|
|Consistency and standards|The cross on PlantInfo sort of looks like you would remove the plant name rather than the plant.|Perhaps moving it up to beside the header.|2|
|Consistency and standards|GardenList has its elements in a list, PlantList has its elements in a grid, and then PlantSearch displays its results in a list.|Either always use a grid or always use a list. Just stay consistent.|3|
|Consistency and Standards|Although there two ways to add the plants, the users might wonder are there any different between them.|We can create an application guide or help section to teacher the user how many ways they can add their plants.|3|
|Error Prevention|Currently, if a user presses the x button next to their garden, the garden is deleted with no “confirm” prompt. |Add a prompt that asks the user to either confirm or cancel their selection.|3|
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|It allows the users to search certain plants by the plants’ name, it may be a problem that make the users spend more time on searching some plants.|We can create a list of plants and store them by different categories, some of users may want to find certain plants based on the categories.|3|
|Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page which can provide information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. Add an information icon at the top right or bottom left of each screen, explaining the functionality and serving as a on the spot tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some users.|4|
|Match between system and the real world|The categorization system would be primarily based on phylogenies.|Users may not understand phylogeny categorization.|2|
|Recognition rather than recall|The search feature requires at least a vague memory of what is being searched for.|Add a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for something.|3|
|User Control and Freedom|It is slightly difficult to return to the home screen as there is no dedicated home button. Currently, the user has to press the back button repeatedly until they reach the home screen. |Add a home button to the top right of the screen. The home button would be a symbol representing a generic house, text can be added to be more descriptive. |3|
|Visibility of System |The search gives the user no feedback; no symbols, prompts, etc. The user simply has to wait and hope that their search returns results. |Have a “loading…” pop up, or a spinner that lets the user know that the system is currently conducting a search. |2|
|Visibility of system status|When the user wants to search for a specific plant in the search bar, it will give the list of plants, however, it never says that this plants is found or not. It might be the case that there are many plants that have the similar name and it will make the users add the wrong plants.|Make a dialog to confirm whether the plant that the users want to search is found or not. |2|
|Visibility of system status|Some of the options in the settings tab change “modes” such as plant naming, language, accounting for weather, etc. which might be confusing to users.|Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. So allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page.|3|

As evident, the "must fix before release" user experience breaking issues we identified were: 
    - The lack of a help feature.
    - The lack of a confirmation prompt when removing a garden.
    - The settings options basically serving as modes.
    - The search feature relying on recall rather than recognition.
    - The plants basically lacking any kind of sorting.
    - The inconsistent layouts used where we have lists for some things and grids for others.
    - The two different ways of adding a plant may be confusing to users.
    - The lack of a return to menu button.

## Raw Heuristic Evaluation Notes

Note: Severity Ratings are in the order of Kevin's, Sebastian's, Jie's and are valued 0 to 4. 
   - Where 0 is not an issue at all and 4 is an experience breaking issue which must be fixed before release.
   - These notes were written independently of each other so there is some overlap.
   - The severity ratings were likewise done independently of each other and in no specific ordering. Obviously for the sake of readability they were formatted into a nice and easy to follow order. This is basically the only thing that differs from our raw heuristic evaluation notes.

### Sebastian's heuristic analysis notes

|Heuristic name|Issue description|Potential solution|Severity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Consistency and standards|The cross on PlantInfo sort of looks like you would remove the plant name rather than the plant.|Perhaps moving it up to beside the header.|2, 3, 1|
|Consistency and standards|GardenList has its elements in a list, PlantList has its elements in a grid, and then PlantSearch displays its results in a list.|Either always use a grid or always use a list. Just stay consistent.|2, 3, 3|
|Visibility of system status|Potentially since there is no progress bar integration into the search feature that can inform the user that their input is being matched against the database then if the search takes too long the user may begin to wonder if everything is still working.|Modify the design of the search feature to include some indication that a search is being processed rather than simply relying on quick results to inform the user that things are indeed happening.|2, 3, 2|
|Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page which can provide information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. Maybe scatter a few question marks throughout the application which can serve as a on the spot tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some user.|3, 4, 3|
|Visibility of system status|Some of the options in the settings tab change “modes” such as plant naming, language, accounting for weather, etc. which might be confusing to users.|Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. So allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page.|3, 3, 3|
|User control and freedom|No easy “return to menu” option. Requires using the back button a lot.|Add a “main menu” that can be swiped form the side or something|2, 3, 3|
|Recognition rather than recall|The search feature requires at least a vague memory of what is being searched for.|Add a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for something.|3, 3, 3|
|Match between system and the real world|The categorization system would be primarily based on phylogenies.|Users may not understand phylogeny categorization.|2, 2, 3|
|Error prevention|There is no check or confirmation required when creating or removing a garden.|Add a page or popup where the user can change the garden name and confirm its creation or deletion.|3, 3, 3|
