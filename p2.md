# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/Qw5wiK7IOP4)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video prototype (linked above) illustrates the process of adding a plant to a garden. This is a common task for our application since users are required to do so before they are able to start managing their garden. In the video, we show the various interfaces the user may encounter, and how the user would typically go about adding a plant to their garden. In addition to outlining how a user would add a plant to their garden, we include a couple of sketches at the end of the video illustrating how the information/properties of each plant will be accessed and displayed.This section occurs immediately after the “info” button is pressed.

## Storyboard

###Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storyboard outlines a series of steps representing the addition of a plant to a virtual garden. More specifically, the storyboard illustrates a sequence of menu screens that the user would see as they carried out the task of adding a plant to their virtual garden. This task was chosen as it helps illustrate many of the features of the application as well as preliminary menu and UI design. 

###Context of Use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task in this storyboard represents many different contexts use, since the user is likely to add a plant to their virtual garden in many different scenarios. This is because the user is required to do so in order to build/manage their virtual garden. Thus, in order to organize and plan garden maintenance, the user must first select the plant(s) they wish to manage. As a result, whether the user wishes to learn more about the properties of a specific plant, schedule maintenance, build a garden, etc., they must first add their plant of interest to their garden. This is likely the most important part of the system, functionally speaking, since the user will be carrying out this task frequently. A more detailed description and accompanying photo of the the storyboard is below:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user starts from “my garden”, which displays the current contents of their garden. Users can then add new plants by pressing the “add new plant” button. This action will redirect the user to a new page displaying two buttons labelled “search by plant” or “search by category”. These two types of search provide two alternative methods to find plants. The first one searches based on the name of plants. It will produce a list of search results of plant names that match the user's input. Alternatively, the user can search based on plant category. This is especially useful if a user wants to select a series of plants that belong to the same phylogeny. According to the category the user attempts to search, a list of plants that belongs to that category will be displayed on the screen. Users can then add plants by pressing the “+” button. They will then be prompted by a “Quantity” selection box, asking them to select the number of plants they wish to add to their garden. They then confirm or cancel their selection by pressing the checkmark or cross button. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the users can press the “info” button to view a more detailed description of the plants. If “info” is selected, the user will be redirected to a new page displaying an image of the plant and a taskbar allowing them to alternate between “image”, “properties”, “watering”, etc. All buttons on this taskbar will change the layout of the screen and display the relevant information relating to the current taskbar selection. Additionally, the users can add new plants here by pressing “add” button (instead of using the previous list representation), and the “return” button will take the users to the previous page (list representation).

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladys is a 60-something year old who has just obtained a smart phone and her grandson has installed the gardening app on the phone for her, as she is an avid gardener and may find it useful. Her grandson has taken the liberty of creating her first “virtual garden”, and leaves it to her to populate it with plants. Gladys particularly enjoys planting roses, but she wishes to determine how often she should water her newly planted red roses. She has very little experience with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
<br>

| Task step<br><br><br> | Knowledgeable?<br>Motivated?<br>Believable | Comments/suggested fixes<br><br><br> |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| a) Opens up the app | ok |  |
| b) Is presented with a menu screen and selects “My Garden List” | Knowledge lacking | Gladys is a first time smartphone user. She may not know she has to select the “my garden list” button first. <br><br>**Possible Solution:**<br>a) Make the buttons as clearly labelled as possible. Avoid clutter.<br>b) Include a “?” button|
| c) Selects the “add plant” button | Knowledge lacking | Gladys wants to figure out how often to water her roses, it may not be obvious that she has to add the plant to her garden first.<br><br>**Possible Solution:** <br>a) Include a “?” buttons to inform users how the application works.<br>b) Include a tutorial. <br>c) Redesign the interface. |
| d) Is prompted by 2 buttons for “Search by Plant” and “Search by Category” and selects “Search by plant” | No motivation to do this! | Gladys task is to figure out how often to water her roses, not add a new plant to her garden. She may have been motivated enough to click the “add plant button”, but by this point she may become frustrated. <br><br>Note: Investigate a possible design solution that can solve this problem. <br><br> **Possible Solution:** <br>a) Redesign the interface to allow users to browse information about plants without first adding a plant to their garden<br>b) Include a tutorial explaining how the |
| e) Is prompted by a search bar, and searches “red roses”  | ok | A search bars function is pretty obvious to a user. Since the search bar is the most prominent thing displayed on the page, Gladys is likely to select it. <br><br>She is also likely to be motivated to do this as she finally sees an opportunity to complete her task. |
| f) Navigates through a list of search results  | ok | The results are presented in a list form. It is easy to read and Gladys is likely to understand what is being displayed. |
| g) Selects the “+” button next to the top hit, “red rose”  | Knowledge low, motivation high | Gladys is glad to see her plant “red roses” displayed in the results. However, Gladys may not know what the “+” button does. <br><br>**Possible Solution:** Add text below the button that reads “add plant” |
| h) Is prompted by a popup asking her the quantity of roses she wishes to add | ok | The purpose of the display is obvious. Gladys is likely to know what the prompt means.  |
| i) Selects the quantity of roses she wishes to add | Motivation low | Again, Gladys task it to figure out how often she needs to water her roses. She may not want to go through building a garden first before finding the necessary information. <br><br>Note: Explore different interface designs that would allow a user to look at a plants properties without having to add it to their garden first <br><br>**Possible Solution:** Add a tutorial explaining how the application works |
| j) Presses confirm | ok | The button is clearly labeled and is coloured bright green. Gladys is unlikely to make a slip here.  |
| k) Is redirected to the main page where all of her plant selections are displayed | ok | Gladys is happy to see her “red roses” displayed in her garden. |
| l) Notices there is an “info” button next to her red roses and selects it | Motivation high, Knowledge lacking | Gladys finally sees her plant displayed, but she may not know that the information button is the one she needs to click to access the roses properties. <br><br>**Possible Solution:** A “?” buttons explaining the meaning of each button on the page might assist her.  |
| m) Gladys is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her roses | ok | At this point, Gladys motivation is high, she sees the red roses on the screen and is closer to finishing her task. |
| n) Gladys sees the heading “plant maintenance” and sees that under it, it says “water 1-2 times/week” | ok | Everything is clearly labeled in this display. It will be easy for Gladys to read the text and understand the information provided. |
| o) Closes the app and goes out to her garden to water her roses  | ok |   |

### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major issue the task-centered walkthrough identified was that requiring the user to first build a garden by adding plants may be frustrating and confusing. Different users have different goals, and building their garden first may not occur to them. Possible solutions included a “?” button to explain the meaning of each button, a tutorial explaining how the application works, or a redesign of the interface which would allow the user to browse information about their plants without having to add them to their garden.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, button naming was determined to be an issue. In some cases, buttons were poorly labeled or their function was not made clear to the user. The best solution to this problem is to label the buttons more appropriately, or use a combination of text and symbols to make their function more obvious.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram
### Description and summary of brainstorming process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going into the brainstorming process, we had a clear idea of the features and issues that needed to be addressed. Thus, over the course of several days, we met up and discussed our solutions to solving those issues as well as arriving at new solutions as a group. More specifically, we rehashed existing ideas and generated completely new design solutions. Additionally, meeting over several days allowed us to sleep on the ideas and features we wished to eventually implement in our application. This allowed us to really think about the efficacy of our ideas and if they were genuinely suitable for our application. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of our sketches during this process was to better explain and visualize our ideas as a group. Additionally, the sketches were used for ensuring consensus around an idea and to serve as an archive of what we had already thought of. Overall, we tried to come up with at least two or three completely unique systems or layouts for each of the major components of our application. That way we were less likely to get stuck on a single set of ideas. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sketching, we relied mostly on paper and pencils and required little else besides glue and scissors. A whiteboard would have come in handy for quickly sketching ideas as a group, but that would have been harder to archive for other parts of the assignment; such as the video prototype or storyboard. As such, we completed our sketches on pieces of paper that we could easily reuse in the video prototype and storyboard.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the process we occasionally ended up mixing and matching elements from existing ideas when coming up with new ideas rather than coming up with completely new solutions. Despite this, we were still able to come up with novel ideas that could be easily implemented.

### Articulation of the Three Separate Sketches

</details>
<summary> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our affinity diagram, we selected 3 separate sketches. More specifically, we selected a group of sketches representing 3 main ideas. The different groupings/sketches are listed below:


#### Garden Management (Design): 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collection of sketches represent one main idea. Namely, the design of the interface for adding, removing, organizing, and browsing through various plants. Each sketch represents a different aspect of the central idea or a possible variation. All sketches depend upon each other in order to manage a person's garden.<details>

</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

#### Home Screen Design: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we experimented with multiple designs for the home screen. One sketch represents the Home screen as a series of buttons containing profile and settings options. As well as a button to redirect to a “My Garden List” which contains all the user's gardens as well as an option to add a new garden. The second sketch is a more visual representation of the ideas communicated in the previous sketch. Rather than have buttons containing text, they are replaced by a Thumbnail with a relevant header and photo. <details>

</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

#### Personalization:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consists of two sketches. From the home screen, the user will have the option to personalize their account. This can mean changing relevant settings (such as layout, colour, language, etc) or fill in profile details (Age, Country, Profile Pic, etc). More specifically, the settings tab contains options for Display, Language, and Location. In the Display tab, the user can modify text size, theme, and how plants are categorized. The language tab gives the user the option to select a different language or enable latin naming for plants. The location tab has the option to enable location services. <details>

</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sketch represents a My Profile tab which contains all of the profile information for the user. More specifically, it contains information relating to the individual's age, location, and gender and a thumbnail picture. There is also a list of general information displayed below the profile pic such as number of gardens, number of plants, time spent on app, etc.

## Reflection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we went through the ideation process we were constantly refining designs as we continued to come up with errors that the user may run into. This made designing the system as a whole difficult, as each step needed to be constantly reexamined as the current implementation was error prone. Eventually, we applied an error analysis approach and designed each UI partly based upon the errors we expected users to make. Additionally, it was difficult for us to come up with many ideas that were truly different from one another. We frequently got stuck on refining one idea and coming up with multiple variations for the same idea. Finally, we found it difficult to sketch all of our ideas as accurately as possible. Some of our ideas were fairly elaborate and sketching them accurately was time consuming and error prone (we frequently made mistakes as we are not used to sketching). In comparison, the storyboard and video prototype went a lot more smoothly. It was much easier to visualize how everything came together, and how to organize our thoughts into a cohesive presentation. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to do this again, we would spend a greater amount of time conducting an error analysis prior to finalizing our idea on paper. This would save us a lot of time spent sketching and re-sketching. Next, we would structure our process such that we forced ourselves to come up with a totally novel idea every few minutes. This would force us to come up with as many ideas as possible instead of making a poorer idea work. Finally, in order to decrease the time spent sketching, we would probably use another method besides simple pencil and paper. Sketching using a whiteboard or software application would actually be quicker for us since we’re not too familiar with visualizing ideas by sketching them with pencil and paper.
