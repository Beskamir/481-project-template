# P1: User Research

## Project Idea: Garden guide (e.g. planning, managing and tracking a garden)

The objective for our project is to create a gardening guide program. Specifically, a mobile application, although ideally it would be nice if it could scale to other system without too much modification. The gardening guide should be able to assist in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a given garden. As such we expect the program to be used for any combination of those objectives by essentially any gardener. Thus, the age group, technological abilities, physical and mental abilities, and gender vary quite a bit in our expected users. However, we expect most of our users to not be technological experts. Since gardening is typically a home hobby then the context under which we expect our application to be used in is a relatively calm and relaxed home setting. Although it is possible that our users will wish to check on their garden while on the go and we intend to make that plausible even though we discourage distracted driving.

## Stakeholders and Users

|Stakeholders|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Investors|Investors are those who finance and believe in our product. They are likely to have prior business experience involving the marketing and likely the development of software (mobile applications, etc.). Investors classify as stakeholders because they are directly impacted by the success of our product. More specifically, they are financially bound to our products success.|
|Users of application|The users are those who will use the product for gardening related purposes (i.e. to manage a garden). Experience is variable, but users most likely have some basic knowledge regarding gardening and technology. Users classify as stakeholders because they directly make use of our product to benefit them.|
|Developers|The developers design and program the software that is utilized by the application. Most likely are software engineers or computer scientists and are familiar with software development. Developers classify as stakeholders because they work on the application and are dependent on its financial success.|
|Sales people (marketing)|The sales people consist of those who sell and market the product to the users and investors. Sales people most likely have a strong background in marketing/sales. Sales people are stakeholders because they are dependent on the product’s financial success.|
|General Employees|The general employees consist of anyone who is an employee of the company that is developing the product. General employee experience varies wildly depending on department and background. General employees classify as stakeholders because they are dependent on the products and consequently the company’s financial success.|


## User Research Methods

The research methods we used during our user research are interviews, survey, and secondary research.
 
 
### Justification:

**Interview:** Interviews are highly informative and easy to carry out. Interviews are also good at obtaining primary data from users of our product. Interviews are good at ascertaining what a user wants and expects from the product. 
 
**Survey:** Surveys are good at identifying particular characteristics and perceptions of users that will use our product. This especially an quick way to obtain answers from a large cohort of individuals.
 
**Secondary Research:** Secondary research is useful in that it allows us to develop a point of view on the state of the current product marketplace.Additionally it allows us to review published material and other relevant sources, in order to develop a more informed perspective on the relevant design issues. 


## User Research Method 1: Interview

<!-- ![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image") -->


#### __Method Description:__
In total we interviewed 4 individuals that we considered to be a relatively decent representation of our target audience. We sat down with them for a couple minutes asking our questions and summarizing their responses directly in the document containing those questions. While all of those questions and the summarized responses are included in this document; we did not update the questions with any of the clarification or prompting that was sometimes needed during the interviews. 

---

#### **Summary of Findings:** 
  - Our interviewees mainly keep track of their garden by memory or visual assessment although one of them uses a calendar.
  - A common issue seems to be finding the time to do gardening.
  - A common goal is to be able to see the results of their work. As in all their plants survive and look great.
  - The participants seemed to be at least somewhat familiar with technology.

## User Research Method 2: Survey

<!-- ![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image") -->

#### **Method Description:** 
The survey we created consisted of 10 questions and none of them were required to be filled out by the participant. Meaning that they basically filled out whatever they wanted rather than having to invent some answer for a question they would have preferred to have left blank. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions so that we could have a more qualitative analysis of the results. Also since closed questions take less time than open questions to answer this was done with consideration of the participants as well. We posted the survey on [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) and then shared the [link to it](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BKSFF79) on social media. That resulted in 12 responses to our survey.

---

#### **Summary of Findings:** 
 - Pretty much all the participants grow some kind of edible plants in their gardens. Indicating that some kind of harvest tracking should be a high priority feature.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q1.PNG "Survey Question 1")

 - Most people seem to spend less than 3 hours on gardening per week, at least on average. This may be related to the "lack of time" responses we got during the interviews.
 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q2.PNG "Survey Question 2")

 - Exactly half of our participants are the only person involved in maintaining their garden. Thus to accommodate the other half we should consider making our application so that it can deal with multiple users working on the same garden.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q3.PNG "Survey Question 3")

 - People tend to either water plants on a fixed schedule or only wait a few days for rainfall. What's interesting is that there are rules about watering plants in Australia and it's unlikely that they are the only country with gardening related laws. Thus as a thought we could consider adding functionality which informs the user of their country's laws and tries to ensure that they don't break them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q4.PNG "Survey Question 4")

 - Most participants seem to get a decent amount of rainfall so we should certainly consider rainfall when designing the watering/maintaining section of our application.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5a.PNG "Survey Question 5a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5b.PNG "Survey Question 5b")

 - Most participants would consider using an application for managing their garden so, unless they are just trying to appease us by answering what they think we want to hear, our application wouldn't be completely useless.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q6.PNG "Survey Question 6")

 - Despite tools for planning/setting up a garden winning by first past the post standards, tools for maintaining/managing a garden seem to be  more desired. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7.PNG "Survey Question 7")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7a.PNG "Survey Question 7a")

 - Question 8 had a bunch of cool ideas we hadn't considered yet such as succession planting or companion plant suggestions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8a.PNG "Survey Question 8a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8b.PNG "Survey Question 8b")

 - Most of our participants were not gardening experts so they may want the application to at least somewhat guide them through gardening.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9a.PNG "Survey Question 9a")
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9b.PNG "Survey Question 9b")

 - As expected most people skipped the last question but there is a comment that such an application would be most useful for managing lots of plants. Thus we should make our UI work just as well with hundreds or thousands of plants as it does with a few dozen.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q10.PNG "Survey Question 10")

 - Overall the survey was more insightful than our 4 interviews even though we considered its questions to be less detailed than the interview questions.
